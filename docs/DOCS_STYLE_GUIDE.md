# Docs Style Guide

This voice guideline is generally aligned with [Mux](https://mux.com?utm_source=github-media-chrome)'s internal voice guideline.

## Style

### Use $0.50 words

Simplify the problem, and break down hard concepts into something easy to understand. This doesn't just apply to programming or technical concepts!

### Be human

Write like you're talking to a peer or acquaintance. Maybe avoid going so informal as you might with your best friend, but our voice is one that's friendly and helpful.

### Speak directly to the listener

Don't pretend they're not there by talking about them in the 3rd person, speak to them directly! Use first person pronouns liberally when speaking from the Mux perspective, and reference the developer or customer in the second person.

### No jargon

Don't expect users of Media Chrome to be experts. Using industry jargon our audience doesn't understand actively alienates them. If something can't be said without a piece of jargon, rethink why that's the case, but then go out of your way to define it.

### Cut to the point

Don't lean on flowery language too much when writing. That's not to say you can't ever use an adjective, but simple and to the point is almost always an improvement.

### Tell a story and make it personal

Use a human and friendly voice. We want developers to feel reading our documentation. Make sure you're not just writing things to check boxes, but rather telling the reader a coherent story. They should be able to imagine themselves solving whatever problem you're talking about!

### Bias for words rather than symbols

In general, spell out a word rather than use a symbol. For instance, use “and” rather than “&”. If you’re constrained for space (e.g. tweet, small text area, etc.) or if you’re making a specific stylistic choice in the context of the comment it’s okay to use the symbols, but the default should be to spell it out, e.g. “Audio and video”.

## Language and grammar

### Sentence case

Default to using sentence case capitalization whenever possible. That means...write titles like a sentence. Start with a capital letter, then capitalize everything else normally.

### Gender

We want to speak to any developer listening, so as mentioned in Style, speak directly to them rather than talk about them in the 3rd person. If you must use a pronoun, use they or their instead of his or her or he or she. When talking about a group, don't use things like guys; "y'all" is both hip and endearing these days, just saying.

### Oxford comma

Oxford commas are useful, cool, amazing, and neato. If you didn't know, the third comma in that sentence is what's called an Oxford comma. 

Use them, no one cares about your esoteric reasoning for not liking them. More often than not they add clarity to a list of words, so always use the serial comma when writing a list of 3 or more things.
